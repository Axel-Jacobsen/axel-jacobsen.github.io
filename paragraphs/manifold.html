      <div class="space personal"> <p>As <a
href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-announces-leadership-transition">Sam
Altman was fired,</a> I got pulled into <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market">prediction
markets</a>, specifically <a
href="https://manifold.markets/">Manifold</a>. It was great for both
following news as it came out (answering questions like “why did that
market just pop up?”) and making some minor profits off of weirder, most
likely false predictions. Overall, I was surprised with the ease with
which a novice predictor (like myself) could take profits off of these
questions.</p>
<p>There are also pretty impressive arbitrage<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
opportunities. For example, I found the following two questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a
href="https://manifold.markets/NealShrestha58d3/sam-altman-will-return-to-openai-by">“Sam
Altman will return to OpenAI by the end of 2024”</a> at ~75%
probability, 439 traders and 110K Mana in volume</li>
<li><a
href="https://manifold.markets/Soli/will-sam-altman-start-a-new-company?r=U29saQ">“Will
Sam Altman start a new company before 2025?”</a> at ~62% probability,
119 traders and 9.8K Mana in volume</li>
</ul>
<p>These two are likely mutually exclusive - I would guess that the
probability of Sam both returning to OpenAI <em>and</em> opening a new
company would be pretty much 0. I would also guess that Sam won’t go
work for, say, Anthropic, Grok, e.t.c., and that most likely he’d use
his opportunity right now to start something new. These are the
assumptions that we use for this trade.</p>
<p>So, let’s do some calculations on what positions we can take, and
what the likely profit would be! Let</p>
<ul>
<li><code>YY</code> be the outcome of Sam rejoining OpenAI and starting
a new company</li>
<li><code>NY</code> be the outcome of Sam not rejoining OpenAI and
starting a new company</li>
<li><code>YN</code> be the outcome of Sam rejoining OpenAI and not
starting a new company</li>
<li><code>NN</code> be the outcome of Sam going to pick flowers or to
live in a cabin in the woods or something.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, by betting either <code>YY</code> or <code>NN</code>, it is very
likely (based on our assumtions) that we will be correct on at least
<em>one</em> of the markets! If that profit is greater than the cost of
betting in both markets, we have a tidy guarunteed profit. Since both
market probabilities were above 0.5, by betting <code>NN</code> we have
a higher potential return, so let’s do that.</p>
<p>For ease of calculation, let’s buy 100 mana worth of <code>N</code>
contracts in both markets, so total cost so far is 200 Mana<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Here’s the payout
table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Outcome</th>
<th>Gross Profit</th>
<th>ROI</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>YY</code></td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0 :(</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code>YN</code></td>
<td>246</td>
<td>1.23</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>NY</code></td>
<td>380</td>
<td>1.9</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code>NN</code></td>
<td>246 + 380 = 626</td>
<td>3.13</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>By our assumptions, we’ll make 23% to 90% profit by this strategy!
All that was left to do was make the trades and wait. Doing so dropped
the probability of Sam returning to OAI from 75% to 72%, and the
probability of Sam creating a new company from 62% to 57%. Time will
tell how I do.</p>
<p>Finally: I feel that this was fairly straight-forward - of course, I
would not be super surprised if I got something wrong and will take a
loss, just because I am new to this. But! If I am right, why has this
not been taken advantage of already? Maybe I am under estimating the
<code>YY</code> case? Maybe other traders don’t care so much (and, if
they were betting real money, they’d take advantage of these trades)? I
think that that is the most likely explanation, and would be very
interested in knowing the answer. Beyond the intrinsic benefits of
trading on Manifold (which are many! I’ve had a blast so far), the
extrinsic benefits are clout and the ability to <a
href="https://manifold.markets/charity">donate their won Mana to
charity</a>. Those are both valuable! But, maybe not as much as USD.</p>
<p>Finally-finally: Maybe it would be possible to get an LLM to find
correlated markets using Manifold’s API? Algo would be something like
“stream in market titles, use <code>gpt-3-turbo</code> to evaluate
correlated markets, and automatically make these hedged trades to make a
tidy profit. Since I wouldn’t be using real money, I’d feel comfortable
offloading most of the evaluation of markets to LLMs. The potential
downside would be cost, especially if you are trying to do
pairwise-comparisons! But, if you decided that you want to donate some
amount to charity, and if this strategy can successfully get more than
100 Mana per $1 of API costs, you would donate more than you put in!</p>
<p>Finale? My previous edit was at 8:40 PM PST, and around <a
href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/breaking-sam-altman-will-not-return-as-ceo-of-openai">twenty
minutes later, news of Emmett Shear becoming the new OpenAI CEO</a> was
released. The markets flipped, and my position was looking pretty good,
so I sold for a nice profit.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Is this actually called arbitrage? I think it would be
in the case where <code>YY</code> and <code>NN</code> are impossible. In
the real world case, I guess this would be called hedging your bets?
Dunno.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>I think that the optimal strategy would be to invest
more in the less probable market and less in the more probable market so
the net profit would be the same for both. That way, expected return
would be higher. But, for ease of explanation and just getting the trade
in, we’ll bet 100 on each market.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>Yea, coming back to this, I think that the main idea
above is correct. We want to bet such that the return for outcomes
<code>YN</code> and <code>NY</code> are equal. Let <code>R1</code>,
<code>R2</code> be the payout rates for event 1 and 2, and let
<code>f</code> be the fraction of your total bet that you’re placing on
event 1. We want <code>R1 * f = R2 * (1 - f)</code>, and the math from
there to determine <code>f</code> is straight forward. To calculate
<code>R</code>s, either fiddle w/ the sliders on Manifold or calculate
from the fact that Manifold uses a <a

Function Market Maker</a> payout function.<a href="#fnref3"

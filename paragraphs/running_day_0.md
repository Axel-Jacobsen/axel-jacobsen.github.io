# Running Day 0
# date 2024-01-15

I'll run the SF Marathon at the end of July this year, and to prepare, I am going to try to run to and from work at least a couple times a week. Today I ran the 12.6 km in 72 minutes, which, with a naive extrapolation, puts me at a 4 hr marathon. That'll be the "bronze" goal, with "silver" being 3hr30 and "gold" being 3hr15.

Let's see how it goes!

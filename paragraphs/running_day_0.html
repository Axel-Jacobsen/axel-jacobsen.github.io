        <p>I’ll run the SF Marathon at the end of July this year, and to
prepare, I am going to try to run to and from work at least a couple
times a week. Today I ran the 12.6 km in 72 minutes, which, with a naive
extrapolation, puts me at a 4 hr marathon. That’ll be the “bronze” goal,
with “silver” being 3hr30 and “gold” being 3hr15.</p>
